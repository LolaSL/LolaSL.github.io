    <h2><strong>Private Policy</strong></h2>
    <p><strong></strong></p>1. What Is a Privacy Policy?
A privacy policy is a legal document that explains to users how you collect, manage, and — if applicable — sell their personal data.

Personal data includes details such as: name, IP address, phone number, and credit card information.

Numerous privacy laws around the world require app and website owners to create a privacy policy for their operations. The following laws include this requirement, and threaten significant fines for businesses that don’t comply:

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — $23 million or 4% of annual global turnover (whichever is higher)
California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) — $2,500 per violation
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) — $750 per person, per violation.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) — $40,654 per violation
Remember: a privacy policy is commonly referred to online as a privacy notice, privacy statement, or privacy policy agreement.

Meet global privacy law requirements by customizing a free privacy policy template to your business needs.

What Is a Privacy Policy URL?
A privacy policy URL is the web address of your privacy policy. Once you’ve created a privacy policy, you need to host it online so users can read about how you handle their data.
